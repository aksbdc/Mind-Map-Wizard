## Mind Map Generation Process

Creating a mind map involves a few simple steps. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **User Submits Topic:**  
   You start by entering a topic or subject that you want to explore in your mind map.

2. **Send to Pro-AI:**  
   Once you submit your topic, it gets sent off to Pro-AI.

3. **AI Processes Request:**  
   The AI takes a moment to analyze your topic and comes up with a structured outline that captures the key ideas.

4. **Formatting the AI-Generated Markdown:**  
   Next, the AI's output is formatted into Markdown, which is a user-friendly way to create structured documents.

5. **Render as SVG:**  
   Finally, the Markdown is transformed into an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format using [markmap.js](https://github.com/markmap/markmap), giving you a visually appealing mind map.
